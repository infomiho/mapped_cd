# Mapped cd

![Mapped cd example](http://ilakovac.com/mapped_cd/example.gif)

This is a simple Oh My ZSH plugin that provides a subset of functionalities of [wd](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd)

This can be also used as a shell script.

## How to

```bash
Usage: c [command] <name>

Commands:
	<name>	Changes your current directory to one mapped by <name>
	add <name>	Maps current directory to <name>
	rm <name>	Removes the mapping by <name>
	list	Print all stored mappings
	show <name>    Show the full path to <name>
	help		Show this
```

## Notes

Initial idea: Stipe Stajp Predanic, wd.

I'm not a shell script expert and any pull request is greatly appreciated.
